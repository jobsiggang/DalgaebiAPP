This can be disabled by passing `REQUEST_PERMISSIONS_AUTO: true` in the options argument.\n\nIf you're running an ejected expo/expokit app, you may run into issues with permissions on Android and get the following error `host.exp.exponent.MainActivity cannot be cast to com.facebook.react.ReactActivity\nstartSpeech`. This can be resolved by prompting for permssion using the `expo-permission` package before starting recogntion. \n```js\nimport { Permissions } from \"expo\";\nasync componentDidMount() {\n\tconst { status, expires, permissions } = await Permissions.askAsync(\n\t\tPermissions.AUDIO_RECORDING\n\t);\n\tif (status !== \"granted\") {\n\t\t//Permissions not granted. Don't show the start recording button because it will cause problems if it's pressed.\n\t\tthis.setState({showRecordButton: false});\n\t} else {\n\t\tthis.setState({showRecordButton: true});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\nNeed to include permissions for `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` inside Info.plist for iOS. See the included `VoiceTest` for how to handle these cases.\n\n```xml\n<dict>\n  ...\n  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n  <string>Description of why you require the use of the microphone</string>\n  <key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>\n  <string>Description of why you require the use of the speech recognition</string>\n  ...\n</dict>\n```\n\nPlease see the documentation provided by ReactNative for this: [PermissionsAndroid](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/permissionsandroid.html)\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-native-voice.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/react-native-voice\n\n[deps]: https://david-dm.org/wenkesj/react-native-voice.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/wenkesj/react-native-voice.svg\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contibutors</h2>\n\n  * @asafron\n  * @BrendanFDMoore\n  * @brudny\n  * @chitezh\n  * @ifsnow\n  * @jamsch\n  * @misino\n  * @Noitidart\n  * @ohtangza & @hayanmind\n  * @rudiedev6\n  * @tdonia\n  * @wenkesj\n","maintainers":[{"email":"tangza@gmail.com","name":"ohtangza"},{"email":"sibeliusseraphini@gmail.com","name":"sibelius"},{"email":"samwenke@gmail.com","name":"wenkesj"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-26T07:18:32.593Z","created":"2016-05-06T19:08:25.934Z","0.1.0":"2016-05-06T19:08:25.934Z","0.1.1":"2016-05-06T19:43:52.912Z","0.1.2":"2016-05-07T00:58:47.545Z","0.1.4":"2016-05-07T01:13:25.524Z","0.1.6":"2016-05-07T01:33:06.646Z","0.1.7":"2016-12-05T18:30:32.709Z","0.1.8":"2017-06-19T18:02:25.673Z","0.1.9":"2017-06-26T17:13:00.481Z","0.1.10":"2017-07-13T17:46:00.264Z","0.1.11":"2017-07-13T18:17:12.190Z","0.1.12":"2017-07-13T18:20:35.555Z","0.2.0":"2017-10-09T01:21:43.879Z","0.2.1":"2017-10-09T01:50:56.146Z","0.2.2":"2017-10-09T13:38:25.182Z","0.2.3":"2017-10-11T13:56:26.085Z","0.2.4":"2017-10-15T20:12:55.067Z","0.2.5":"2017-10-18T18:19:01.048Z","0.2.6":"2018-02-07T23:29:53.873Z","0.3.0":"2019-06-07T15:30:21.051Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-voice","keywords":["android","ios","react-native","speech","voice"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-voice.git"},"author":{"name":"Sam Wenke","email":"samwenke@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-voice/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jk6":true,"liorgrosman":true,"ramiroespada":true}}
